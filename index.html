          <h2>Kristian Bj&oslash;rnard</h2>
          <p>Kristian Bj&oslash;rnard is a designer, thinker, and sustainabilitist. He lives in Baltimore MD (with his partner Nancy) where he is the director of &ldquo;The Office of Kristian Bj&oslash;rnard,&rdquo; a boutique design studio focused on publishing in all its forms &mdash; web, print, books, magazines, text, images, objects&hellip; whatever &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; might mean. Kristian holds an MFA in Graphic Design from MICA and a BA in Studio Art from Kalamazoo College. Current design experiments and research center around the question &ldquo;what sustainable graphic design looks like?&rdquo; This has led to a more purposeful interest into what &ldquo;systems&rdquo; mean when integrated into a design practice; a focus on rules-based design concepts; the generation of personal &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; aesthetic exercises; fighting the tide of entropy; and investigating what we can learn from vernacular methodologies. Kristian also explores various aspects of time and motion as they relate to graphic design and keeps abreast of current web trends, standards, and technologies. All of these interests: systems, sustainability, motion, contemporary web technology, etc. all make for interesting insights and connections when working on projects in both the classroom and a professional practice.

          <h2>Ben Ransom</h2>
          <p>I attended the University of St. Thomas and studied entrepreneurship. Not knowing what to “start up” during college, it was difficult to apply these Entrepreneurial teachings towards a specific idea or existing venture. I made the conservative decision after school to join the corporate world. As I progressed through my professional career, I’ve been able to gain important business expertise while formulating and fine-tuning new business ideas, connections and opportunities. Since 2007, I’ve been involved with a successful start-up wind assessment service company within the Wind Energy industry. A larger German corporation with whom I currently work for as a Business Development Executive subsequently bought out the start-up business in 2011. Although my passion for Renewable Energy is strong and I take pride with my work within Wind Energy, I’ve come to the conclusion my true satisfaction and drive is to start a company of my own and try to steer it towards success. Start Up and Go was created to provide a platform for us to give constructive feedback and utilize our unique specialties to push all of us over the edge towards acting on our ideas and dreams.</p>
          <p>I enjoy sailing, coffee, x-country skiing, film photography, renewable energy, architecture, cycling, vinyl, strumming guitars, landscapes, and paddling my way to a beginner surfer.  Self proclaimed talents – Ferocious Google searcher, and the uncanny ability to accurately estimate just the right amount of tinfoil to cover the baking dish every time.</p>
